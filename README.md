# Abandoned - YoungTech BackEnd (E-commerce)

## Project status
I had fun with this project for a while but I'm going to abandon this
because I don't understand what the hell I'm even doing.

I haven't really dive deep into many deep programming concepts throughout my
journey and there are a lot of abstractions (frameworks, tools, libraries,
etc..) that I use but don't even have idea how they work. I mean, I know
what the frameworks do and the APIs they expose to make it easier to
build software, but I don't know how to make a lot of this 
things by myself.

I'm going to take some time to learn all the things that I don't understand
yet and maybe in the future I can rewrite this project.

My idea is to be able to write every tool I use from scratch
and not only need other's spaghetti code to glue basic and common
functionality one needs to build software.
